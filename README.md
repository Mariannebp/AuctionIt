Type: Semester Project 2
When: Fall 2022
Where: Front End Development course, Noroff School of technology and digital media.

## Description

This is an auction website where users can add items to be bid on, and be able to bid on items listed by other users.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

On this website the users will be able to:
- register with a @stud.noroff.no email
- login if the user are registered
- logout if the user are logged in
- update their avatar if logged in
- view their total credit if logged in
- create a listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description if logged in
- use credits and add a bid to another userâ€™s listing if logged in
- view bids made on a listing if logged in
- all users may search through listings
